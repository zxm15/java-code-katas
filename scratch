shortest valid parenthesis

assume we have a list<Character> containing all invalid parenthesis


1. how to match them?
a. insert a matching for each (worst) {[(
b. (((({)))) two pointers matching
({)] two options: match left pointer or match right pointer?
dp could solve it and return the min

However, does it represents all the cases?
yes. why?

for a parens, it has two options:
1. insert a matching one
2. looking for a matching one in the the remaining list,
if found, cut the array into two parts, find the min of left and right
if not found, return Integer.MAX_VALUE;

our two pointers way also make sure the two options:
1. insert
2. looking for matching one in the list.
